            <p class="text-3">Style panels to have a background image and a heading. Used Flexbox to align
                everything, and then added a little bit of JavaScript so that on click, it changes the
                class to active, and expands with a CSS transition. Used JavaScript for the event listeners.

            <p class="text-3">Build progress steps and you might see these in different kinds of websites with
                forms, basically like multi level forms, shopping carts, things like that, just a progress bar that
                starts at one and just goes along here.

            <p class="text-3">Here we have the little rotating navigation icon. We have two icons, open and
                close. We're going to position them so that when we click it rotates and shows the close
                button and the hidden Menu. We need a little bit of JavaScript to add and remove the specific class.

            <h5 class="text-2">Hidden Search Widget</h5>
            <p class="text-3">A hidden search widget, that has this button with a little search icon
                from Font Awesome, and as it's clicked, it fires off a JavaScript event that activates a specific
                class
                for the transition. We'll be using CSS along with JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class.

            <h5 class="text-2">Blur Image Loading</h5>
            <p class="text-3"> Blurry loading page or loading image. We're just doing a blur effect on the image.
                And we'll have to map different number ranges to the 0 to 100 load. And there's a stack overflow
                function that we're going to use to help us do that, to help us map one number range to another.

            <h5 class="text-2">Scroll Animation</h5>
            <p class="text-3">Build a scroll animation. On some websites when you start scrolling and parts of the
                site images, pages or sections of the website start to come in. We've created these content blocks
                and you can see there are three to begin with.So we're going to use CSS transitions to have it come
                in smoothly. We're going to use JavaScript to tell where the trigger point is for the next box to
                come in. And then we're going to add a specific class to show and remove the class when it
                hits the trigger point and it'll all slide back out.

            <h5 class="text-2">GitHub Profiles</h5>
            <p class="text-3">We're going to use GitHub API to fetch users. We're going to be able to search for
                GitHub users to get some of their profile data and display it in a card. And we're also going to
                make a separate request to get at the user's latest five repositories or however many you want to
                add to add to the card. So these are the docs for the GitHub REST API. Other thing we're going to
                do is use Axios instead of the Fetch API. So Axios is a library. It's a promise based HTTP client
                library for the browser and node.js. The error handling is better. Let's go ahead and get into it.

            <h5 class="text-2">Split Landing Page</h5>
            <p class="text-3">We're going to createa split screen with a background image with an overlay with
                some content inside. And if we click on one side, it's going to stretch out to about 75%, the other
                side 25%. If I hover on the right side, it's going to do the same thing.We'll add a
                little hover effect onto these. It's going to be very CSS heavy. We'll do a little bit of JavaScript
                at the end for the hover effects, but lots of CSS in this project.
